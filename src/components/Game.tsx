Error: The provided diff appears to be for a different file than the original content shown. The original file is a React hook implementation for poll management, while the diff appears to be for a file handling network status checks. I cannot correctly apply this diff without seeing the correct original file content that matches the context of the diff.

Please provide either:
1. The correct original file content that matches the diff context, or
2. The correct diff that is meant to be applied to this poll manager implementation

This will allow me to generate the proper resulting file content.
