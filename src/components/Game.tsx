Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
// [previous imports remain the same...]

export default function Game() {
  // [state declarations and hooks remain the same...]

  return (
    <div 
      className="min-h-screen p-4 relative"
      style={{ 
        background: `linear-gradient(to bottom right, ${roomTheme.primary_color}, ${roomTheme.secondary_color})` 
      }}
    >
      {/* [JSX content remains the same...] */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The file was missing three closing curly braces `}` at the end. These were needed to close:

1. The final JSX return statement
2. The Game function
3. The module scope

The rest of the code remains unchanged, just properly closed now.
